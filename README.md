# Eintstein Network Project
A project that attempts visualize the people Albert Einstein knew in a friend-of-friend way. Additionally, it aims to visualize the network of the friends of Einstein in a recurisive manner. It continues to be a work-in-progress and is based on a 2014 version of the MEAN stack boilerplate from: http://meanjs.org/

# Notes and Lessons Learned
* This has quite a lot of work to do if it were to become a usable piece of software
* Moreover, I may not have known this at the time, but it was a way I got introduced to the MEAN Stack
* With the knowledge I have now, I might just start over
* This project makes use of technologies that were modern at the time -2014-, but now they are quickly becoming obsolete -2016-

## Tech stack via http://meanjs.org/
Make sure you have installed all these prerequisites on your development machine.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager, if you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install bower globally using npm:
```

```
* Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install grunt globally using npm:
```
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
